# Supply-Chain-Analyst-Case-Study
I analyze historical data from foreign grain markets to inform the investment strategy of a venture capital firm 
looking to enter the microbrewery market. 

The data was time-series, geospatial, and descriptive in nature. I utilized multiple large datasets for the analysis, pertaining to 
crop production data, crop price data, and international financial data like exchange rates with respect to currency conversion. 

To perform the analysis, I utilized R & SQL. In particular, I used unique queries & a variety of R packages for the analysis. 

Throughout this case study, I acted effectively as a supply chain analyst. 

During my analysis, I performed a variety of tasks to inform the key stakeholders about foreign grain markets. 

This insight is helpful as the US Venture Capital firm is considering foreign grain markets to help meet its 
supply chain requirement for its potential investment in the microbrewery and microdistillery industry. 

Using these key insights I found throughout my analysis, the key stakeholders can be better informed when making an 
executive decision with respect to supply chain concerns.  

For full information, please refer to my write-up of this case study given in the Word Document in this Repository.
